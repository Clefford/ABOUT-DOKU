used to be a smart and succesful person (before the whole kidnapping)
same universe as rent , and tazvm and bellas oc's 

he will kill, yes
old subject turned to nurse, has a chip/mark behind left ear, sometimes tries to cut it off, but its useless since it regenerates anyways - it reminds him of someone he hated, the old person that used to experiment on him - keeps that scientist's body in the morgue, wishes to revive him so he can do the things he's always wanted with him (making him suffer)

used to get "touched" and experimented on, so much that it permanently affected him, and only because the scientist "liked" him, he wasnt much of a subject, since he was treated differently than other subjects, basically only for the scientists pleasure , he was taken when he was somewhere 13 yr old, the scientist was like mid 40's (plus had a wife and kids) 

his method is basically dissecting and disembowling the victim - all for finding cures and medicine, he believes it for a better cause! hostile towards non-nurses  
likes to keep his hair short, his hair was kept long the entire time he was a subject because the scientist liked it 
likes pink because he was given a pink bow by a child - the only person who was kind to him, that child was supposedly killed by the scientist, to experiment on her body and blood, and the scientist being the weirdo he is, decided it would be good if doku helped him in the experimenting process, he originally had brown hair and dark brown eyes

he was clumsy, so the scientist decided to experiment on him (by adding a syringe that could cure people with one single injection, with a 20% chance on poisoning you instead though) the tail, so that he could be more useful to the scientist, also why he's hard to kill, and he's immune to poison (since his blood is 70% poison from all the experiments)

the heart earrings were given from the scientist and he's scared enough of the scientist (even though hes dead) that he cant bring himself to take it off,
